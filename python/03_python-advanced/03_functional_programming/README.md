# Functional programming 
This course of 2h is composed by one main [notebook](./FProgramming-course.ipynb) that we invite you to open right now by opening a terminal and running.

In the term of this course you will know concepts of functionnal programming in python and how it can make your code simpler and easier to debug.
As a bonus, we also provide a full [TP](./Hacking%20mystery.ipynb) where you will put in practice different concepts of the course.
