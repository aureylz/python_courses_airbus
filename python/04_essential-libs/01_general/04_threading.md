## What is this?

Python threading allows you to have different parts of your program run concurrently and can simplify your design. If
youâ€™ve got some experience in Python and want to speed up your program using threads, then this tutorial is for you!

## How to install?

Nothing todo, it's available by default in the python environment :)

## How to use it?

### Development

Import the module

````python 
import threading
````

Integrate it in your code

````python
x = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(1,))
````

### Usage

Write a python script as follow

````shell
import logging
import threading
import time

def thread_function(name):
    logging.info("Thread %s: starting", name)
    time.sleep(2)
    logging.info("Thread %s: finishing", name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    format = "%(asctime)s: %(message)s"
    logging.basicConfig(format=format, level=logging.INFO, datefmt="%H:%M:%S")

    threads = list()
    for index in range(3):
        logging.info(f"Main    : create and start thread {index}")
        x = threading.Thread(target=thread_function, args=(index,))
        threads.append(x)
        x.start()

    for index, thread in enumerate(threads):
        logging.info(f"Main    : before joining thread {index}")
        thread.join()
        logging.info(f"Main    : thread {index} done")
````

And execute it by CLI:

````shell
$ python hello.py
22:51:05: Main    : create and start thread 0
22:51:05: Thread 0: starting
22:51:05: Main    : create and start thread 1
22:51:05: Thread 1: starting
22:51:05: Main    : create and start thread 2
22:51:05: Thread 2: starting
22:51:05: Main    : before joining thread 0
22:51:07: Thread 0: finishing
22:51:07: Main    : thread 0 done
22:51:07: Main    : before joining thread 1
22:51:07: Thread 1: finishing
22:51:07: Thread 2: finishing
22:51:07: Main    : thread 1 done
22:51:07: Main    : before joining thread 2
22:51:07: Main    : thread 2 done
````
